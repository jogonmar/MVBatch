Installation

	- Extract the rar file in a directory of your choice <directory_path>

	- Add to the MATLAB path the following directories (use command addpath, e.g. addpath '<path>'):
		- <directory_path>
		- <directory_path>/BigData
		- <directory_path>/GUI


Please, acknowledge the use of this software by refercing it: "Camacho, J., Pérez, A., Rodríguez, R., Jiménez-Mañas, E. Multivariate

suggestions, please contact josecamacho@ugr.es

We would like to thanks the direct or indirect contribution of several colleagues:

- E. Szymanska, G.H. Tinnevelt and T.P.J. Offermans for the Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS) routine.
- G. Zwanenburg, H.C.J. Hoefsloot, J.A. Westerhuis, J.J. Jansen and A.K. Smilde for the ANOVA Simultaneous Component Analysis (ASCA) routine.
