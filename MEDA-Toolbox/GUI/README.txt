NOTE: This GUI has been designed to work with the MEDA Toolbox. It is necessary to download the MEDA toolbox to work with this GUI.

There are two ways to work with the MEDA toolbox: using the GUI (starting users) and using the commands (expert user). The GUI is self 
explanatory. It incorporates help messages to guide its use. To launch the GUI, type "EDA" in the command line of Matlab after the 
installation. Also, in the Examples directory of the MEDA toolbox Graphic User Interface, an EDA example based on the GUI is included. It is suggested to
have a look at it. Use the provided User's Manual and the data set (MANET) in the Example directory to start working with the GUI.
