function [p_corr,p2_corr] = SignChangeControl(p,p2)

% Sign correction to account for potential rotational ambiguity inherent in 
% PCA models so that loadings that can be compared across models. 
%
% [p,p2] = SignChangeControl(p,p2) % minimum call
%
% INPUTS:
%
% p:  [MxA] loading matrix corresponding to first latent-variable model
%
% p2: [MxA] loading matrix corresponding to first latent-variable model
%
%
% OUTPUTS:
%
% p_corr:  [MxA] sign-corrected loading matrix corresponding to first latent-variable model
%
% p2_corr: [MxA] sign-corrected loading matrix corresponding to first latent-variable model
